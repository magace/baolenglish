Let me start with saying I am not a programer I just like to tinker with things. :)

This is not finished I just got what I need out of it for now and figured I would post it to see if anyone wanted to improve or play with it.

Requirements:  Python, pyautogui, and PySimpleGUI
Probably 1920x1080 resolution unless you can do the math to convert it.

Basic explination of the program.
The program uses image search to indentify what tab were looking at.  The images are saved in images folder.  If its not detecting the correct tabs try creating new images?
Once a image is detected it just splashes the defined text at x y positions.  Pretty simple not much to it.
